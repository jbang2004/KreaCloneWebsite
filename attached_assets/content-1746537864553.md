## Frequently Asked Questions

What are compute units?

Compute units are a measure of computational resources used to generate images or videos.
They represent the processing power, memory, and time required for each creation.
Different tasks consume varying amounts of compute units based on their complexity and
output quality. For example, generating a high-resolution image or a longer video will use
more compute units than a smaller image or shorter video.

Can I roll over unused compute units to the following month?

Compute units do not accumulate or carry over between billing cycles. At the start of each
month, your compute unit balance is reset to your plan's allocated amount, regardless of any
unused units from the previous month. This ensures a fresh start and consistent resource
availability for all users each month.

What options do I have if I exceed my compute unit limit?

If you exceed your compute unit limit, you have several options to continue your work:

- 1\. Upgrade to a higher-tier subscription with increased compute units.
- 2\. Purchase additional compute units to complement your current plan.
- 3\. Utilize your daily free compute units, which automatically refresh each day.

How can I get additional compute units?

Additional compute units are available on the [compute packs](https://www.krea.ai/account/compute-packs) page to users with a subscription. These supplementary units serve as a backup, activating only
when your plan's allocated units are depleted. Once purchased, they remain available for use
within 90 days

How can I monitor my remaining compute units?

To monitor your compute unit usage, click your profile picture in the top-right corner to
view a quick summary. For a more detailed breakdown, visit your [account usage](https://www.krea.ai/account/) page, where you can track your consumption over time and manage your resources effectively.

Is it possible to modify my subscription plan?

Yes! You can easily modify your subscription plan at any time. Simply navigate to your [account](https://www.krea.ai/account) page, where you'll find options to manage and adjust your current plan to better suit your
needs.

What is Krea's refund policy?

Users with an active subscription who have used less than 650 lifetime compute units are
eligible for a refund and can request one on the [account](https://www.krea.ai/account) page.
