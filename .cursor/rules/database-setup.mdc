# Database Setup (`db/` & Drizzle ORM)

This project uses Drizzle ORM for database interactions.

## Key Components:

*   **[db/](mdc:db)**: This directory likely contains database schema definitions, migration files, and other database-related scripts.
    *   Schema files would define the structure of database tables.
    *   Migration files track changes to the database schema over time.
*   **[drizzle.config.ts](mdc:drizzle.config.ts)**: This is the configuration file for Drizzle ORM. It specifies how Drizzle connects to the database, where schema and migration files are located, and other ORM settings.

## Operations:

*   **Schema Definition**: Define your database tables and relationships in TypeScript files, usually within the `db/` directory (e.g., `db/schema.ts`).
*   **Migrations**: Use Drizzle Kit CLI commands to generate SQL migration files based on schema changes (`drizzle-kit generate:pg`) and apply them to the database (`drizzle-kit migrate`).
*   **Querying**: Use Drizzle ORM's query builder in your application code (both client-side if applicable, and server-side) to interact with the database.
