# Server-Side Application Structure (`server/`)

The `server/` directory contains the backend application code.

## General Structure (Assumed):

*   **Entry Point**: There is likely a main entry file (e.g., `index.ts`, `server.ts`, `app.ts`) that starts the server.
*   **Routes**: API routes defining the application's endpoints.
*   **Controllers/Services**: Logic for handling requests and business operations.
*   **Models**: Data models, possibly interacting with the database defined in the `db/` directory and configured via [drizzle.config.ts](mdc:drizzle.config.ts).
*   **Middleware**: Functions for handling requests before they reach the route handlers (e.g., authentication, logging).
*   **Configuration**: Server-specific configuration files.
*   **Utilities**: Helper functions and modules for the backend.

To understand the specific structure and technologies used in the backend, the contents of the [server/](mdc:server) directory need to be examined.
